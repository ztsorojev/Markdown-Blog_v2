# Markdown Blog Editor - v2
Full Stack development of a blog allowing users to login, write, save and edit their blog posts written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

It is the updated version of the [older blog](https://github.com/ztsorojev/Markdown-Blog) I created.

**Stack:** Angular, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

## Features

Login (for now, users are created manually in MongoDB)
